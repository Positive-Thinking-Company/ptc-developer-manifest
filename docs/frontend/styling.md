# Theme and styling

## Usage of a CSS preprocessor

## Avoid import caveats

## Use theming as recommended

All the design systems (Angular Material, Material UI, Vuetify, Quasar...) come natively with their way of applying the app theming and styling their components.<br/>
Using it the more possible instead of bypassing it with custom css improves the theming development speed, the maintainability and avoid strange graphical effects.

## Use a naming convention

The BEM naming convention is the most known and used one: https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/#selectors
