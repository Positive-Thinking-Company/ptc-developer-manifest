## The **need** to be up to date

!> Outdated runtime and/or dependencies can **introduce new vulnerabilities** that can be exploited

Checking if all the dependencies of a web application are up to date is important for many reasons:

- It ensures that the application is running on the most stable and secure version of any dependencies
- It also allows for the application to take advantage of any new features or bug fixes that the latest version of the dependencies may have

## Technical Debt

The longer you take to update to the latest versions, the more technical debt will increase on your project.
As technical debt builds up, the developer (maybe you?) will fear to make update on your projects.
By updating regularly all the dependencies, you're ensuring that the newly introduced code will not build additional debt on your project as it will be using the latest features of your framework and dependencies.
