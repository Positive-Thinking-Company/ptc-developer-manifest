# Dependencies for Node.js


## Check for new versions
If using **yarn**:
`yarn upgrade-interactive --latest`

If using **npm** only:
`npm outdated`

## See dependency graph

Sometimes it's useful to see what dependencies are bound to internal (inferred) dependencies.
To view that graph in npm, type: `npm ls -a`
